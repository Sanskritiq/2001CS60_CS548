## Problem Statement

- Given: [MatLab code of the feature selection for classification problems](https://github.com/mayank265/Matlab-Wrapper-Feature-Selection-Toolbox)
- Develop equivalent python code for the feature selection

#### Other Details

- With `NF-BOT-IOT_train_preprocessed.csv` as input, the feature selection will provide the output columns that is required.
- Using this `NF-BOT-IOT_train_preprocessed.csv` as input and output 38 csv containing the information shown in the format like `NF-BOT-IOT_BBA_feature.csv`
- Filename format: `NF-BOT-IOT_(Feature_Selection_Algo_Name).csv`
